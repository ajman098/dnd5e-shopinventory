FAQ
===

#### Q: I have found a layout issue or a major issue in one of the core items, what should I do? ####
A: Open an issue at https://github.com/ajman098/dnd5e-quickref/issues. Even better: fork the project, fix the problem, and post a pull request.

#### Q: I have an idea for a minor tweak, such as adding actions specific for my character. How do I modify the content of the sheet? ####
A: Open the subfolder called `js`, and edit one of the `data` files. Ask your local computer geek for help if you don't know how to edit those.
