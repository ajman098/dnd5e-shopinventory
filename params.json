Set up each 'card' as a different category of item\r\n2. List under each category the available items with a price or \"Out of Stock\"\r\n3. Each price will have a \"low\", \"average\" or \"high\" marking based on its relation to average market price\r\n4. An ability for GM to generate and freeze prices as well as name the shop\r\n5. Update listings to include any 5E items, as source is 3.5\r\n\r\n\r\nStretch Goals\r\n=============\r\n\r\n1. Add an icon for each item\r\n2. Add an onclick description for each item\r\n3. Generate a random \"delivery time\" for items that are out of stock\r\n\r\n\r\nIcons\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAll icons are provided by http://game-icons.net/\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n===\r\n\r\n#### Q: I have found a layout issue or a major issue in one of the core items, what should I do? ####\r\nA: Open an issue at https://github.com/ajman098/dnd5e-shopinventory/issues. Even better: fork the project, fix the problem, and post a pull request.\r\n\r\n#### Q: I have an idea for a minor tweak, such as adding actions specific for my character. How do I modify the content of the sheet? ####\r\nA: Open the subfolder called `js`, and edit one of the `data` files. Ask your local computer geek for help if you don't know how to edit those.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREDIT\r\n======\r\n\r\nAny and all credit for the layout and code of this project goes to crobi. You can see the original 5e quickref here: https://github.com/crobi/dnd5e-quickref\r\n\r\nThe concept and a lot of the legwork comes from Jacob Valdez's Shop Inventory Spreadsheet.
